# Follow-Me-Robot Prototype


# Overview
This project involves programming an Arduino Uno to create a motion-following robot capable of tracking and responding to nearby objects and people. The robot utilizes a combination of DC motors, motor driver shield, infrared sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and servo motors to achieve its functionality.

The code in this repository enables the Arduino to process sensor data and control the robot's movement. The robot is designed to move forward, turn left or right, and stop based on the input from the sensors.

# Features
Ultrasonic Sensor: The ultrasonic sensor measures distances to detect objects and people in the robot's path.

Infrared Sensors: The infrared sensors on the left and right help the robot navigate by detecting obstacles on its sides.

Servo Motor: The servo motor is used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor, enabling it to scan its surroundings.

DC Motors: The DC motors, controlled by a motor driver shield, provide the robot's mobility.
